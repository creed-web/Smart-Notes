## 🔧 Troubleshooting Highlighting Issues

### Issue: Highlighting Not Appearing
**Solutions:**

- Try refreshing and translating again

### Issue: Highlighting Stuck on Blue
**Solutions:**
- Wait for translation to complete (large pages take longer)
- Check internet connection
- Look for error messages in browser console

### Issue: Highlighting Not Fading
**Solutions:**
- Wait 5-10 seconds for automatic cleanup
- Refresh the page if highlighting persists
